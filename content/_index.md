## Toolkit

The DHCC Toolkit contains resources for Digital Humanities researchers, and other researchers and professionals who use digital tools, for minimising the environmental impact of our work and contributing to a just climate transition. The toolkit has multiple pathways, but here is one suggestion to navigate through:

- [Introduction]({{< relref path="./toolkit/introduction.md" >}})
- [Minimal Computing]({{< relref path="./toolkit/minimal-computing.md" >}})
- [Maximal Computing]({{< relref path="./toolkit/maximal-computing.md" >}})
- [Project Planning]({{< relref path="./toolkit/project-planning.md" >}})
- [Advocating Within Your Institution]({{< relref path="./toolkit/advocating.md" >}})
- [Decision Trees]({{< relref path="./toolkit/decision-trees.html" >}})
- [Climate Change FAQs]({{< relref path="./toolkit/climate-change-faqs.md" >}})

### A Manifesto

[Digital Humanities and the Climate Crisis](https://dhc-barnard.github.io/envdh/)

“The digital is material. As digital humanists, every project we create, every software application we use, every piece of hardware we purchase impacts our environment. [...] As humanities researchers, it is also our role to probe the values, the power structures, and the future imaginaries that underpin sustainable solutions.”

### A Researcher Guide to Writing a Climate Justice Oriented Data Management Plan

Our Information, Measurement and Practice Group has published this guide which aims to help researchers think through the climate-related implications of decisions about data management and project planning.  It includes an annotated DMP.
